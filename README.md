# re_academiaTimer
Recreation of the timer from the TV show "My Hero Academia."

Assets and code created from scratch. Coded in GM: Studio with Gamescript, assets created in GIMP with screencapped references from the show.

Features:
- Functions identically to the show
- Allows for custom setting of the timer (maximum cap of 59 minutes, 59 seconds since the original did not have hours)
- HUD components are fully functional and accurate
- Play/Pause functionality, and Stop (Reset) ability

To-Do List/Known Concerns (that will probably never get done):
- Add sound effects (difficult since no clean source files)
- Interval values may spill off and be difficult to read
- Interval values are rounded
- Text listing min/sec isn't always accurate (since if the timeline is only seconds, there are no minutes to list)
